### How to load a Jupyter notebook file into Google Colab:

Direct Method from Colab:
You can open a GitHub notebook directly from Colab using the following steps:

- Go to Google Colab (`https://colab.research.google.com/`)
- Click on File > Open notebook.
- Select the GitHub tab.
- Paste the GitHub URL (`https://github.com/jcabbasi/SCIML2024workshop`) or search for the repository (`SCIML2024workshop`) by name, in my account (`jcabbasi`).
- Select the notebook you want to open, and it will load in Google Colab.
- Then, enjoy playing with the tutorial. :wink:
